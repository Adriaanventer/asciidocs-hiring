<p>Hiring is not what it used to be; you’re trying to hire the best people, but so is everybody else. The melee that ensues can be tough to navigate at the best of times, and without a well thought out hiring strategy you’re going to make it much harder than it needs to be for smart people to figure out why your company is the one where they want to be working.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Demand for quality tech candidates currently far outstrips supply and it’s not going to change any time soon. Now more than ever, securing a steady supply of talent is a strategic and competitive necessity. As an adaptation, we have seen a strong indicator of successful hiring as being a transformation from a <strong>filtering mindset</strong> (how can I make sure that people are good enough to work at my company), to an <strong>attraction mindset</strong> (how can I make sure that everything about my company is awesome enough so that all of the best people will want to work there).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot has been written about how to do this most effectively and a whole bunch of companies have tried many different things. Over the last 2 years we’ve been lucky enough to not only be able to have conversations with over 700 of SA’s top tech companies about their hiring processes, but to see them play out from both the company’s and candidate’s perspectives.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Try to have one person take ownership of hiring for any given role. This will help with accountability and minimise the chances of balls being dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be extremely responsive with candidates - you should never be the bottleneck in your own hiring process.
Optimise for speed. Your goal should be to put an offer of employment in the hands of somebody who meets your criteria as quickly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that drop-off will occur throughout every stage of the process, so it’s important to maintain a strong pipeline of candidates in various stages of the interview process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The golden thread that should run through your entire process is the candidate experience. Always assume that the person you’re interviewing is going to tell their friends/community members about their experience interviewing at your company.</p>

<h2 id="_reaching_out">Reaching out</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step of your hiring process should be to focus inwardly and decide who is going to be running it. If you can’t settle on a single person to care about the whole process, then be sure to go into detail in terms of which people are going to take ownership of the individual parts of the process. We have found that the person closest to the role that you’re hiring for should conduct the initial outreach (IE, if you’re hiring a developer, the dev manager or head of product should be reaching out).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on how strong your brand is, this initial message could potentially be the first time the person you’re reaching out to has heard of your company, so it’s super important that you’re able to convey your employer value proposition (reasons why your company is an awesome place to work) concisely and convincingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of different styles of outreach that we have seen in the wild on OfferZen, we suggest picking the one that aligns best with your culture and goals.</p>

<p>An employer value proposition is the name given to a broad category of things describing the reasons why somebody would work for your company rather than another one. It is explicitly different to your actual product, meaning you can have an awesome offering but a terrible employer value proposition if you don’t make an effort to provide people with a great place to work. Components of your employee value proposition include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Financial benefits</p>

<li>
<p>Perks</p>

<h3 id="_super_personal_message">Super personal message</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nothing gives a somebody the warm fuzzies like seeing a message from an interested company that addresses them as individual. Making specific references to parts of a person’s profile that you found particularly interesting is a great way to prove to somebody that you’re serious about engaging with them meaningfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind that personalising every message can take time, so be mindful not to let that affect the number of people that you reach out to. Ultimately you should be looking to strike a balance between thoughtful, personalised outreach and building a healthy candidate pipeline. If you’re concerned about time, try creating a template or two that you partially customise for different scenarios.</p>

Would you be keen to jump on a quick call so that I can tell you more about the role?

<h3 id="_short_message">Short message</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you feel that your brand speaks for itself, you can sometimes get away with a really short message without too much background. While this might work some of the time, you run the risk of overestimating the reach of your fame. Some people might think twice about making time in their calendar’s to meet up for coffee with somebody from a company they’ve never heard of prior to being contacted with a cryptic one-liner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re going to adopt this strategy for your opening conversation, make sure that you provide other ways for candidates to find out more about you. Making sure your company’s OfferZen page is up to date is a great first step towards this. Including links to any press articles that were written about you as well as any public Github repos will be super helpful to convey to people some of the interesting stuff that you do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re sending a super short message just because it’s quicker, consider if the time you’re saving is worth potentially underselling your company and losing out on hires.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong> “Hi, I’m the head of product at OfferZen and I’d love to chat to you about an opening that we have for a senior Ruby Dev. Check out our profile and send me your contact details so that I can give you a call to tell you more if you’re interested :)”

<h3 id="_long_message">Long message</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your company does a lot of cool stuff and you want to tell people about all of it, in detail. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with being radically transparent about everything you do from the very beginning, it’s important that this doesn’t take the form of an impenetrable wall of text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introductions like these can be particularly effective if you think that it’s unlikely that people will have heard of your company before or if you’re concerned that your company ‘isn’t sexy enough’. Most people are primarily interested in having the opportunity to solve interesting problems with an awesome team; selling that you’re able to provide this to somebody as early on in the process as possible can be a great way to get buy-in for the rest of the hiring process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to a highly personalised message, these longer messages can take time to put together. To make it quicker it can be helpful to create one or two really high quality messages to use as templates that you can adapt to specific conversations where appropriate.</p>

We’re working on rebuilding our backend using Clojure and are looking for people who are interested in learning more about functional programming in general as this is the direction that we’re looking to take going forward. We’ve received a lot of funding recently and are looking to build a world class team, product and work environment.

<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good news; they like you, or at least they’re interesting in talking to you to find out more about what you do. At this point, all you probably know about the candidate so far is what you’ve read on their profile, and their knowledge about you is probably derived entirely from a combination of your website and OfferZen profile, which is usually not quite the full story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How you approach this part of the hiring process will fall somewhere on a spectrum, with you trying to filter out people who ‘aren’t good enough’ on one end and ‘convincing people that your company is the best’ on the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you consider this in the broader context of tech hiring in its current state, it should be obvious that your goal ought to be trying to adopt more of a selling mindset. There are potentially a host of other competing organisations all trying to tap into the same talent pool as you are and if you’re not making an effort to convince candidates why they should choose to work with you, you’ll quickly start losing out to companies who are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your goal at this point in the hiring process should be to maximise knowledge on both sides of the table; candidates should know as much about the work that you do, and you need to know as much as you can about them so as to be able to figure out whether or not they’ll be able to make an impact in your team.</p>

When considering how to structure your initial conversations with people, the medium is an important factor. A face to face discussion should always be first prize, but keep in mind that it can be tough for somebody to find time to do this. Always offer to meet somebody at a location that is most convenient for them, even if it entails a bit of a drive (remember that your selection efforts up until now should mean that you think that this person is at least solid enough to warrant this kind of effort).

The types of questions asked during this kind of interaction will usually be focussed around the candidate’s educational background, their past work experience and filling in any gaps that were left after reading their profile. It’s also very important to provide an opportunity towards the end for the person you’re talking to to ask any questions that they might have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this approach can give you a great deal of information in a relatively short amount of time, it can easily leave candidates feeling like they’ve just sat through an interrogation and will potentially do very little to promote a positive candidate experience.</p>

<h3 id="_sales_call">Sales call</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other end of the spectrum to the traditional screening call, we find something that is closer to a sales call. Rather than looking for reasons to filter somebody out, the goal here is to effectively sell the role, the company and its mission as well as the interview process itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting buy-in like this is extra important if your hiring process has multiple steps. It’s pretty optimistic to assume that somebody will take time off from their current job to finish your 3 hour technical assessment and sit through an on-site panel interview with your whole management team without any work from your end to sell the idea of working at your company and being part of your team as being worth all that effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This should generally be the strategy that you adopt if you’re trying to build a hiring process that promotes a positive candidate experience. Remember that there’s nothing wrong with asking a few questions during a chat like this, as long as you remember that it’s just as important to sell the role and your company to the person you’re talking to.</p>

<h2 id="_technical_assessment">Technical Assessment</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your goal is to build a high quality product, everybody on your team should be up to snuff from a technical perspective. Anyone who isn’t pulling their weight can be a drain on the rest of team and will severely limit your ability to move quickly, which is why an effective technical assessment process is so important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question that you should be asking yourself when deciding on how to do this is “am I trying to filter people out, or am I assessing to find out what people’s strengths are?”. Sequencing also becomes a consideration at this point; an assessment that is administered closer to the beginning of the process should be designed to determine whether somebody possesses the baseline competencies that are necessary for them to perform well in a given role, while one that is carried out towards the end can be more focussed on confirming what a candidate’s strengths are in order to ensure that they are given work that engages them from day one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something that a lot of companies often forget at this stage, is just how competitive technical hiring can be. Any candidate that you’re talking to is most likely engaging with other companies as well and having a cumbersome, poorly designed technical assessment strategy is a good way to make sure that your process finds itself at the bottom of a candidate’s to-do list as they prioritise processes that are more respectful of their time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proper briefing is also super important when conducting any kind of technical assessment. A poorly briefed assessment project that you think shouldn’t take more than 4 hours, can end taking the whole weekend to complete if you’re not clear on exactly what the deliverables and goals of the project are.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="_technical_interview">Technical interview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is potentially the most abstract of the options available to you when looking to assess technical ability. While it can be the most convenient from a candidate experience perspective, it’s also extremely reliant on the person running the interview being highly technical themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The effectiveness of a technical interview hinges entirely on the strength of the questions that you ask as assessment tools. While it might feel good to ask a trick question that somebody outside of your building or specific might struggle to answer, you generally want to stick to questions that will allow candidates to showcase their own skill.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you decide to adopt this strategy, it’s massively important that the interviewer has a good grasp of the problem that they’re asking the interviewee to solve. Somebody who doesn’t have a solid understanding of the problem themselves will struggle to move the discussion forward which will greatly limit the amount of information that you’re able to gather about somebody’s technical abilities.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_whiteboard">Whiteboard</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classic combination of whiteboard and marker can be a really useful to tool to determine somebody’s technical capabilities, as long as you make sure to be extra clear up front on what it is you’re assessing. Presenting somebody with an empty whiteboard and telling them to start designing solutions can be stressful at the best of times and will probably not result in them putting down their best work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reality is that this kind of assessment is most effective at teasing out whether somebody can logically structure a solution to a given problem, which is something that should be made clear up front or even well in advance of the interview itself. Remember that your goal should be to assess somebody’s potential rather than ask them to showcase how well they can perform in a made-up test scenario; you’re conducting a technical assessment, not planning a technical ambush.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_paper_programming">Paper programming</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to whiteboard assessments, a strategy that we sometimes see employed is asking somebody to complete a paper based coding test. While whiteboard assessments will typically involve a number of people looking at and discussing a problem, a paper based assessment lends itself more to the traditional paradigm of completing a test paper and handing it in, limiting the amount of insight that you’re able to obtain about how the candidate approached solving the problem at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s possible to negate these drawbacks by taking time to ask the candidate to run you through the answers that they submitted, however at this point you might as well have used a whiteboard assessment making paper based tests hard to recommend as an efficient assessment mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="_take_home_project">Take home project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A take home project is exactly what it sounds like - a piece of work that you assign to a candidate to complete in their own time. As with all of the other types of assessment, it’s massively important to be explicit about what it is that you’re assessing, what the deliverables are and how long you expect somebody to set aside for the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A well briefed assessment project can easily be used as a jumping off point for a technical discussion during an interview. Getting somebody to talk you through their solution can be incredibly insightful and can tell you a great deal about their decision making and communication style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making sure that you assign projects that are relevant to the work your company does unlocks the additional benefit of giving the candidate a window into what to expect should they accept an offer of employment from you. If you’re trying to hire people who enjoy solving interesting problems, be sure to make the assessment you’re asking people to dedicate hours to as engaging and representative of an actual day’s work as possible.</p>

<h3 id="_online_test">Online test</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re trying to optimise your hiring process to be able to handle really high volumes of people, then an online test can be a good way to accomplish that. These kinds of assessments have the advantage of being able to be administered remotely, and are usually designed to be completed in the candidates own time within a specified time limit. This makes them much easier to fit into a schedule, provides a well defined block of time within which to focus while also preventing overly meticulous candidates from taking a weekend to complete what should be a 2 hour assessment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The negative aspects of this approach are centred around the impersonal nature of the assessments and the way in which they’re deployed. If you decide to include this in your interview process, make sure that somebody takes ownership of it. It should be this person’s responsibility to maintain the integrity of the assessments (don’t send out the same test for months and years at a time, switch it up every now and then) while also moving people through the pipeline and being available as a human to talk to if the person taking the test has any questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that there will usually be costs involved in using an online code assessment service, either in the form of a subscription or per-use fee.</p>

The automatic scoring systems that many of these online testing tools use often lack the ability to pick up on nuance, meaning that smart developers often don’t get results that reflect their true ability. This can be counteracted by making it part of your process for a human to review the code that gets submitted.

<h3 id="_pair_programming">Pair programming</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pair programming assessment involves assigning somebody from your existing team sitting with and collaborating (either remotely, or by physically sitting at the same workstation) to solve a single problem. This technique can an extremely effective way to gauge a number of key metrics, from technical ability and problem solving skills, through to communication ability and collaboration. It does however come at a significant cost in terms of preparation and the involvement of multiple members of your existing team, so it’s not to be undertaken lightly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common theme so far has been that briefing is critical to an effective technical assessment, and pair programming is no different. Well executed pair programming assessments will always be explicit up-front about the differentiation between the assessors and the people that the candidate will be programming with. Poorly run pair programming sessions can easily result in a candidate being hesitant to explore all of the solutions at their disposal, which is understandable when you consider how easy it is to feel like the person sitting next to you is judging your every keystroke.</p>

Your culture is the set of (usually) unwritten rules that your company has collectively determined for how you are all going to work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As companies grow, they tend to get better at explicating their own cultures, but in the beginning when you’re still figuring things out it often comes down to unwritten rules and implicit patterns of doing things. Because of this ephemeral nature, it can be hard to make sure early on that new hires align with and augment your existing culture; which is why it’s so incredibly important to have a method in place that you use to try and tease out what the values and motivations are of people you’re looking to employ.</p>

<p>The opinions of people that have been living and breathing the culture already can be a really useful barometer when assessing overall fit. Carrying this out in a structured way will usually involve some planning, where short slots are booked with a number of members of team for them to have informal discussions. These are not only useful for you, but for the candidate as well, as they give them an opportunity to pose questions that they might not feel comfortable asking in a traditional interview scenario. If you decide to go down this route, remember to take some time to debrief everyone involved and gather their feedback.</p>

<p>A simulation day involves a candidate taking time to come to your office for a full day or two to do real work with the rest of your team.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This comes at a pretty steep cost in terms of both time, planning and dedicated team resources during the course of the simulation days.

<h3 id="_founder_chat">Founder chat</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While a company’s culture cannot be created overnight by any single person, the leaders and founders have the most influence in setting the tone and deciding on the direction that it takes. Every hire that you make shapes this fledgling culture, doubly so in a company’s early stages. In order to be able to make informed decisions about who should be allowed to influence this growth, founders should be talking to every new hire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As important as this discussion is as an assessment tool, a culture is made from the values of more than just the founders, so It’s important to be cognisant of just how much stock you’re putting in just one or two people’s opinions when doing something like this. A pretty bad situation would be one where you’ve hired a number of people and the only thing that they have in common is the shared trait of “well the founders liked them”, so if you’re able to diversify the number of people you get input from, you should definitely do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once your team and hiring process start to scale significantly, it can be very easy for a founder’s limited availability to become a bottleneck. We often see this happening around the 50 hire mark, however we’ve seen examples of companies where the founders personally chat with everyone well past hire number one hundred. If this situation arises, keep in mind that there are other options available outside of shepherding two people into a coffee shop booth; tools like Skype or Google Hangouts can make it a lot easier to fit meetings like these into people schedules.</p>

Whatever you decide, it’s important that you stick to it. It’s scarily easy to get swept up in the smiles and good vibes that are in the air after interviewing somebody that really fits in with the team and seems to tick every box that you threw at them, but that’s not necessarily a good reason to short circuit your own process.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, try to avoid calling a reference before you’ve spoken to the candidate yourself. It might feel useful to have a heads up before they’ve even come in for an interview, but remember that you’ve just potentially coloured your own first impression of this person with somebody else’s opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should go without saying that you should always be respectful of the private nature of the candidate’s job search. <strong>NEVER</strong> phone somebody’s current workplace without their explicit permission, and don’t solicit your own personal network for information without doing your own homework. The world is a small place, even more so in tech. People can be connected in unexpected ways, so it’s advised to limit your reference checks to people that the person that you’re hiring has provided for this purpose.</p>

If you’re worried about giving somebody who isn’t settled in the building access to your entire code base, remember that it’s not an all or nothing decision. Give as much access as you’re comfortable with as early on as possible and take things from there.</p>

<p>If you use Slack and you haven’t already invited them as part of your interview/assessment process, now is a great time to get them set up. One fun side effect of this is that every time they get a slack notification from you, you’re going to be top of mind.</p>

<p>We’ve seen companies assign paid work to a new hire as soon as they begin employment. As smart as it is to dial up the engagement to 11 in the time before somebody starts at your company, you still want to be mindful of the fact that they’re potentially still legally employed somewhere else.</p>

<p>Getting somebody to start working for you as soon as they’ve signed your contract regardless of current obligations might seem like a great way to keep a new hire engaged even before day one, however you do need to think about what problem it is that you’re trying to solve by using this approach. If you’re primarily concerned about staying top of mind, there are other way to accomplish that without potentially doubling somebody’s workload.</p>

<p>Whatever hiring process you end up designing for yourself should have the dual goals of being able to effectively move people through it’s stages quickly and efficiently, while also providing an awesome experience to the person going through it.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you can’t go wrong if you ask yourself the following question at every part of your process: <strong>“Regardless of whether I end up hiring this person or not - are they going to walk out of an interview wanting to work at my company?”</strong></p>
